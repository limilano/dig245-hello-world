      <center><h3>File Organization and Naming</h3></center>
      <center><p style = "max-width:600px">In this activity, I reviewed the best ways to name files.
        Some of the important takeaways are the differences between PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case,
        and SCREAMING_CASE and how/when they’re used as well as how to structure your project files.
        In this project, I am using kebab-case, and adding the section each image/file will be used in so I know where it belongs.
      </p></center>

      <center><h3>API</h3></center>
      <center><p style = "max-width:600px">
        In this activity, I learned about APIs and the relationship between clients, servers, and databases.
        The client is where you make a request for information, the server processes and queries a database,
        and the database functions like a search engine and returns all the data it contains on the given query.
        For this activity, I downloaded Postman, and used a GET request to retrieve and view an example of the information a
        database may return. I also learned about authorization and browsed a few no auth APIs such as Random User Generator,
        which generates a random person and their information, including an image, phone number, address, etc…

             <td>One interesting project I found is called <a href="https://www.geokitten.com/">Geo Kitten</a>.
             Essentially, Geo Kitten is a website where you pick between images of kittens and it slowly narrows
             down where you live until it knows your exact town. This project is about internet privacy, as it's not using
             your kitten preference to know where you live, it's using your IP address. This project can be found through an
             online children's game called <a href="https://www.boredbutton.com/">boredbutton</a>. For a lot of people in my
             generation, Geo Kitten was our first exposure to the concept of online privacy and just how much websites know about you.</td>

             <td>The second project I found is called <a href="http://www.planecrashinfo.com/database.htm">Plane Crash Info</a>,
              which was created to provide a comprehensive list of all the plane crashes that have occured, how many people died,
              and what caused the accident (if they know). This website provides some perspective on how few plane crashes occur relative
              to how many planes are flying as well as shows how fatal a plane crash can be. I've always found aviation interesting and while
              this is a rather morbid website, I think it's important for people to know how rare plane crashes are and what typically
              causes them.</td>
           </tr>

           <tr>
             <td>The final project I found is called <a href="https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/virus-explorer">Virus Explorer</a>.
              It's an educational online project that visualizes different major viruses, how they spread, what kind of host they infect,
              if there's a vaccine available, etc... It appears to be updated regularly and includes information on COVID and how it compares
              at a basic level to other viruses. I think this project is a great learning tool and I really love how it looks and functions.</td>

<!-- The hardest part of this project was definitely the tables,
even using online resources I initally had a really hard time making
the table cells even. I tried other methods to try and make the pattern
I wanted with the images and text alternating but I ended up circling
back around to using a table. I figured out that you could apply the style used for
the images on the table so that helped a lot. It's not completely even and
sometimes the text goes out of the bounds I wanted, but overall I think it looks pretty good.  -->
